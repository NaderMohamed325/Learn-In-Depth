## Overview
This project implements a pressure controller system designed to enhance cabin safety by alerting the crew when the cabin pressure exceeds a specified threshold of 20 bars. The alarm system is activated for a duration of 60 seconds to ensure the crew is adequately informed of the overpressure condition.

## Usage
The system will automatically start monitoring the cabin pressure upon powering up.
If the pressure exceeds 20 bars, the alarm will be activated and will sound for 60 seconds.
The system will continue to monitor the pressure and will re-trigger the alarm if the condition persists.
