# Data Structure and Algorithm


A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and manipulated efficiently. It defines a specific format for organizing and storing data, along with operations that can be performed on that data. Data structures are essential in computer science because they provide a means to manage and manipulate large amounts of data effectively
